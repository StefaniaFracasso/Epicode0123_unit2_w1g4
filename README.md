<h2>Creating animations with CSS</h2>
<p>The exercise aims to get you confident with CSS Animations, through the development of two separate exercises to recreate:</p>
<ol>
<li>A transition/transformation effect to create a slate of post-it notes that animate as the mouse hovers. The transition should be smooth.</li>
<li>A cyclic animation effect on a set of 3 words present at the end of a sentence, to make the last word of the sentence change automatically, making one of the three words in the set appear each time. The animation involves the word appearing in absoluteness from the top and then fading down; once it disappears, the new word will appear. </li>
</ol>
